# Class diagramme

## Constructors, Getters, and Setters
For the sake of brevity and in order to keep the UML as compact as we decided just to mention Constructors, if they are somehow "special", otherwise we didn't show them in the class diagram. Furthermore, we made most of our variables mostly private, but didn't specifically created Getters and Setters as methods, as this would blow up the class diagramms unnecessarily.

##Â Classes and strukts without connections
Some of our classes and strukts are not connected to any other class. The reason for that is, that they are never "stored" or kept as a state anywhere in the programme, but they are just temporary intermediate results which are returned by one function and later consumed by another one.
